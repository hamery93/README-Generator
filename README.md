## Description of project:  
Dynamically generates README based on user response. The inspiration behind this project was to make it easy to generate a quality README with less effort required from the user. The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
